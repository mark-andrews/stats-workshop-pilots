# About the Stats 1 workshop pilots

* From October 2019, all new[^new_students_only] Psychology students 
  will use R instead of SPSS in all statistics and research methods modules.
* We are piloting a few introductory Stats 1 workshops to help us prepare for teaching Stats 1 
  using R next year.
  
[^new_students_only]: This will not affect current students, who will continue learning and using SPSS.

# What is R and why should you care

* R is a program for doing statistics and data analysis.
* R's advantages relative to SPSS come down to three inter-related factors:
  * It is immensely powerful.
  * It is free and open-source.
  * It is very and increasingly widely used.

# R: A power tool for data analysis

The range and depth of statistical analyses and general data analyses that can
be accomplished with R is immense.

* Built into R are virtually the entire repertoire
  of widely known and used statistical methods. 

* Also built in to R is an extensive graphics library.

* But the *secret sauce* of R is its vast set (presently, over 14000) of add-on packages. 
  
# R: Open source software

* R is free and open source software. 
* Likewise, virtually all of contributed R packages are likewise free and open source.
* In practical terms, this means that is freely available for everyone to use, now and forever,    on more or less any device they choose.


# R: Popularity and widespread use

* R is widely used across academia, businesses, government, health care industry, etc.
* Across these sectors, R is consistently ranked as more widely used and as a more sought after skill than SPSS.
* We believe that knowledge of R is valuable transferrable skill that can increase students' employability. 


# A guided tour of RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./rstudio_with_editor.png')
```

# First steps in R

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      prompt = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment='#>')

# Thanks to 
# https://github.com/ramnathv/slidify/issues/189#issuecomment-15850008
hook1 <- function(x){ gsub("```\n*```r*\n*", "", x) }
hook2 <- function(x){ gsub("```\n+```\n", "", x) }
knitr::knit_hooks$set(document = hook1)

```

* A useful way to think about R, and not an inaccurate one either, is that it is
simply a calculator.
```{r}
2 + 2 # addition
3 - 5 # subtraction
3 * 2 # multiplication
4 / 3 # division
(2 + 2) ^ (3 / 3.5) # exponents and brackets
```

<!-- #  Equality/inequality operations -->

<!-- * Testing for the equality or inequality of pairs of numbers, -->
<!-- already starts to go beyond the usual capabilities of handheld calculator. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- 12 == (6 * 2)         # test for equality -->
<!-- (3 * 4) != (18 - 7)   # test for inequality -->
<!-- 3 < 10                # less than -->
<!-- (2 * 5) <= 10         # less than or equal -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Logical values and logical operations -->

<!-- * In the previous step, the results are returned as either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. These are logical or *Boolean* -->
<!-- values. -->
<!-- * Just as we can represent numbers and operations on -->
<!-- numbers, so too can we have two logical values, `TRUE` and `FALSE` (always written in -->
<!-- all uppercase), and Boolean operations (*and*, *or*, and *not*) on logical values. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- TRUE & FALSE  # logical and -->
<!-- TRUE | TRUE   # logical or -->
<!-- !TRUE         # logical not -->
<!-- (TRUE | !TRUE) & !FALSE -->
<!-- ``` -->

# Variables and assignment

* If we type the following at the command prompt and then press Enter, the result is displayed but not stored.
```{r}
(12/3.5)^2 + (1/2.5)^3 + (1 + 2 + 3)^0.33
```

* We can, however, assign the value of the above calculation to a variable named `x`.
```{r}
x <- (12/3.5)^2 + (1/2.5)^3 + (1 + 2 + 3)^0.33
```

* Now, we can use `x` as is it were a number.
```{r}
x
x ^ 2
x * 3.6
```

<!-- # Assignment rules -->

<!-- * In general, the assignment rule is  -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- name <- expression -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- The `expression` is any R code that returns some value. -->

<!-- * The `name` must consist of letters, numbers, dots, and underscores.  -->
<!-- ```  -->
<!-- x123   # acceptable -->
<!-- .x -->
<!-- x_y_z -->
<!-- xXx_123 -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * It must begin with a letter or a dot that is not followed by a number.  -->
<!-- ```  -->
<!-- _x   # not acceptable -->
<!-- .2x  -->
<!-- x-y-z -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * The recommendation is to use names that are -->
<!-- meaningful, relatively short, without dots (using `_` instead for punctuation), and primarily consisting  -->
<!-- of lowercase characters. -->


<!-- # Vectors -->

<!-- * Vectors are one dimensional sequences of values. -->
<!-- * For example, if we want to -->
<!-- create a vector of the first 6 primes numbers, we could do the following. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * We can now perform operations (arithmetic, logical, etc) on the `primes` vector. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- primes + 1 -->
<!-- primes / 2 -->
<!-- primes == 3 -->
<!-- primes >= 7 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Indexing vectors -->

<!-- * For any vector, we can refer to individual elements using indexing -->
<!-- operations.   -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- primes[1] -->
<!-- primes[5] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- * If we want to refer to sets of elements, rather than just individual elements, -->
<!-- we can use vectors (made with the `c()` function) inside the indexing square -->
<!-- brackets.  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- primes[c(3, 5, 2)] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- * If we use a negative valued index, we can refer to or all elements *except* one. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- primes[-1] -->
<!-- primes[-2] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Vector types -->

<!-- * A vector be a sequence of numbers, logical values, or characters. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nation <- c('ireland', 'england', 'scotland', 'wales') -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * We can index this vector as we did with a vector of numbers. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- nation[1] -->
<!-- nation[2:3] -->
<!-- nation == 'ireland' -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- * The `class` function in R will identify the data type of the vector. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- class(primes) -->
<!-- class(nation) -->
<!-- class(nation == 'ireland') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Data frames -->

<!-- * Data frames are rectangular data structures; they have certain number of -->
<!-- columns, and each column has the same number of rows. Each column is in fact a -->
<!-- vector. -->

<!-- * Usually, data frames are created when read in the contents of a data file, but we can -->
<!-- produce them on the command line with the `data.frame()`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Df <- data.frame(name = c('billy', 'joe', 'bob'),  -->
<!--                  age = c(21, 29, 23)) -->
<!-- Df -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Indexing data frames -->

<!-- * We can refer to elements of a data frame in different ways. -->
<!-- * The simplest is to use double indices, one for the rows, one for the columns.  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Df[3, 2] # row 3, col 2 -->
<!-- Df[c(1, 3), 2] # rows 1 and 3, col 2 -->
<!-- Df[1,] # row 1, all cols -->
<!-- Df[, 2] # all rows, col 2 -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- # Indexing data frames (contined) -->

<!-- * We could also refer to the column by name. To do so, we -->
<!-- could use the following `$` notation. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Df$age -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * An alternative syntax that accompishes the same thing is to use -->
<!-- *double* square brackets as follows. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Df[['age']] -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * A *single* square brackets, we would -->
<!-- obtain the following. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- Df['age'] -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Functions -->

<!-- * In functions, we put data in, calculations or -->
<!-- done to or using this data, and new data, perhaps just a single -->
<!-- value, is then returned. -->
<!-- * There are probably hundreds of thousands of functions in R. -->
<!-- * For example,  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- length(primes) -->
<!-- sum(primes) -->
<!-- mean(primes) -->
<!-- median(primes) -->
<!-- sd(primes) -->
<!-- var(primes) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- # Custom functions -->

<!-- * R makes it easy to create new functions.  -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- my_mean <- function(x){ sum(x)/length(x)} -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * This `my_mean` takes a vector as -->
<!-- input and divides its sum by the number of elements in it. It then returns this values. The `x` is a -->
<!-- placeholder for whatever variable we input into the function.  -->
<!-- * We would use it just as we would use `mean`. -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- my_mean(primes) -->
<!-- ``` -->


# Writing R scripts

* Scripts are files where we write R commands, which can be then saved for later
use.
* You can bring up RStudio's script editor with Ctrl+Shift+N, or go to the
File/ New File/ R script, or click on the New icon on the left of
the taskbar below the menu and choose R script.

* In a script, you can have as many lines of code as you wish, and there can be
as many blank lines as you wish.
```{#numCode .R .numberLines}
x <- 42

y <- x + 1

z <- 2*x + 3*y

```
* If you place the cursor on line 1, you can then click the Run icon, or press the Ctrl+Enter keys.



# Code comments

* You can put "comments" in a script.
* A comment allows you write notes or comments around the code.
* In R, anything following the `#` symbol on any line is
treated as a comment.
```{.R .numberLines}

# Here is a script that does stuff.

x <- 42 # Assign a value to x

y <- x^2 # The square of that number

z <- x*2 # Multiply by 2

```

# Packages

* The easiest way to install a package is to click the  Install button on
the top left of the *Packages* window in the lower right pane.

* Having installed a package, it must be loaded to be used. This can be done by clicking the tick box before the package name in the *Packages* window, or use the `library` command.
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

# Reading in data

* R allows you to import data from a very large
variety of data file types, including from other statistics programs like SPSS,
Stata, SAS, Minitab, and so on, and common file formats like `.xlsx` and `.csv`.

* When learning R initially, the easiest way to import data is using the *Import Dataset* button in the Environment window.

* If we use the *From Text (readr)...* option, it uses the `read_csv` R command, which we can run ourselves on the command line, or write in a script.

```{r}
data01 <- read_csv("data01.csv")
```

# Viewing data


* The easiest way to view a data frames is to type its name.


```{r}
data01
```


# Viewing data (continued)

* Another option to view a data frame is to `glimpse` it.
```{r, echo=F}
options(width = 50)
```

```{r}
glimpse(data01)
```

```{r, echo=F}
options(width = 100)
```

# Summarizing data with `summary`

* An easy way to summarize a data frame is with `summary`.

```{r}
summary(data01)
```
